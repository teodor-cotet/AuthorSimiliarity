htmls files contain 2 types of sections:
    -small (authors+publications)
    -big (authors+publications)

we have 2 categories which are indexed in es:
    -authors:
        * name: name of the puauthor
        * short description: lifespan, titles # TODO get info from this
        * quotes: 
        * important author: y/n
        * writings: 
        * references:
        * description: rest of the text
    -publications
        * name: name of the publications
        * description: rest of the text

stats for each section:
    big (355 in total only authors):
        failed (to extract name): 3 / 355
        authors: 352 / 355
    small ((1464 in total) - publications + authors):
        failed-pub-and-authors (to extract name): 128 / 1464
        good-publications-total: 455 / 1464
        good-authors-total: 881 / 1464
    
    in the end we get:
        good-authors: good-small-authors + good-big-authors = 881 + 352 = 1233
        good-publications: 455

other observations:
    -authors and publication may be mixed sometimes, they are distinguished by a short list of keywords
        that are common in publications
    authors:
        -short description contains generally name (not so often) function and lifespan, should be alright in 90% of cases
            for the parsed authors
        -important_author is a tag that marks if the original publications had a big space between the name of the author 
            and the text (generally this implies that the author is important - has more text)
